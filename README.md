# Raumkernel
C++ Kernel for Communication with Raumfeld Multiroom System

Unfortunately most of the code ist a mixture of C++11 and boost libraries for some reasons (eg. Regex was broken in standard C++11 in gcc, aso..)
Next aim would be to get rid of the boost libraries (use new gcc versions) and to remove\rewrite all of my bad code. 
It was my first project after a very long time of C++ abstinence, so currently i think the code is not the nicest one on the market ;-)
